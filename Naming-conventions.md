# Naming conventions
When you are working with digital media, you are often working with lots of bits and pieces: many files that are part of a larger project, and possibly many versions of files... and you may be working on many projects at once! So you'll need to be able to find things easily, move groups of files together so that the way they are linked - thier directory structure - doesn't get broken, and so on. AND, for everything each of you submit for class, __I'll__ need to know whose work is whose - ***we have at least two Annas in this class!***

## A real, art world example:
When you apply for a grant, group show or residency, very often you''ll be submitting electronic documents to a web portal. Usually that includes a CV, an artist's statement, and 5-10 images. The org you are applying to needs to manage, not just your application, but everyone else who applies, so they will tell you to use a naming convention (and file formats as well) for all of the fiiles you submit... something like:
*Lastname-Firstname-Image-01.jpg*
