# Naming conventions
When you are working with digital media, you are often working with lots of bits and pieces: many files that are part of a larger project, and possibly many versions of files... and you may be working on many projects at once! So you'll need to be able to find things easily, move groups of files together so that the way they are linked - thier directory structure - doesn't get broken, and so on. AND, for everything each of you submit for class, __I'll__ need to know whose work is whose - ***we have at least two Annas in this class!***

## A real, art world example:
When you apply for a grant, group show or residency, very often you''ll be submitting electronic documents to a web portal. Usually that includes a CV, an artist's statement, and 5-10 images. The org you are applying to needs to manage, not just your application, but everyone else who applies, so they will tell you to use a naming convention (and file formats as well) for all of the fiiles you submit... something like:

***Lastname-Firstname-Image-01.jpg***

## For the KILLER PROMPT project:
We'll collaborate on a single prompt, a text file, that can be used to generate a sticker (or stickers) for the open source conference. Along the way, you'll create branches off of the main file, as well as your own files to experiment with.

- For branches off the main file, name them: Lastname+somethingdescriptive
- For Files you create, name them: Lastname+somethingdescriptive.TXT

Note: for the files you create (not branches) - add the .txt extension. 

## The point
Files and branches can be named anything, but having naming conventions makes everything more readable and less ambiguous for **ALL** of the collaborators. But naming conventions are a good habit to get into, both for your collaborators, and for yourself. And it makes James' life easier when it's time to grade!
