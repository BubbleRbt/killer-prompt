# The Killer Prompt
We're going to use this repo as a playround to
1. learn how GitHub and repos work, with particular attention on how it is a tool for artistic collaboration, and
2. explore and design absurd, groovy, surreal text prompts that we can use to generate stickers for the upcoming [Open Source Conference](https://ospo.gwu.edu/open-source-conference-gw-oscon) here at the unitiversity.
