# The Killer Prompt
We're going to use this repo as a playround to
1. learn how GitHub and repos work, with particular attention on how it is a tool for artistic collaboration, and
2. explore and design absurd, groovy, surreal text prompts that we can use to generate stickers for the upcoming [Open Source Conference](https://ospo.gwu.edu/open-source-conference-gw-oscon) here at the unitiversity.

# Per David Lippert at OSPO:

We invite anyone in the GW community to create open source stickers for our GW OSCON that will be held on March 24-25, 2025. The GW OSPO will select a few of the sticker designs that meet all the requirements listed below and pay to print the stickers and make them available for all attendees of the conference.

[Design requirements:](https://github.com/gw-ospo/gw-open-source-stickers/issues/5)

- Please adhere to our code of conduct
- Please follow our contributors guide for instructions about how to submit your designs
- Extra points for collaborating, being creative, and for highlighting some of the themes of the conference (openness, sharing, transparency, innovation, community building)
- Final designs due by Feb 10th, 2025

Here is the color palette for the conference logo, but there is no requirement to use these colors.

Here is a list of some additional topics that our conference will explore for the purpose of inspiring more sticker designs:

- How do we bridge the open source gender divide?
- Open source for good
- Open versus closed, which is better for innovation & security?
- Continuous Open Science (is Agile science possible?)
- Open source for artists and poets
- OpenAI is not open source
- How do we build a GW open source community?
- How do we measure goodness?
- The open source community is a global interconnected network with the power to amplify human progress
